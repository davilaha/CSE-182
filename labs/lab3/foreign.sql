Each cage in the CageVisits table must appear in the Cages table. (Explanation of what that means appear in the above paragraph.) 
If a Cages tuple is deleted and there are CageVisits for that cage, the deletion should be rejected. 
Also, if the Primary Key of a Cages tuple is updated, and there are CageVisits for that cage, then the update should be rejected.
